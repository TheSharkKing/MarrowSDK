# Sharing Packed Content

Once your content is packed, you can share it with others. Ensure the process completes successfully before distribution.

Click the **Zip** button to compress this folder and all of its contents into a single zip file with its folder structure intact.  This file is what should be uploaded to distribution sites like Mod.io.
