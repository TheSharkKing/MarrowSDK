Getting Started
---

- On first launch, until you've created a Pallet, the editor will display a <i>Getting Started</i> window that will guide you through ensuring the SDK has <i>automatically</i> detected your game installation folder.  If not, the Game Install Locator will provide several options to find it.

- Setting your game install will add the External BONELAB Content Pallet, which gives you access to all Bonelab vanilla content, like spawnables, avatars, the full game soundtrack and several ambient sounds that can be used when making your own content.

![assetwarehouse](./Images/UnityProjectModules/asset_warehouse.png)

- Use the Asset Warehouse button in the upper left of the Unity window to display the Asset Warehouse whenever you need it. 

- Create a Working Pallet, select it in the Asset Warehouse and add a new Level Crate.
- The Default Marrow Scene will create a basic template that includes the essential components of a level, so you can focus being creative!
