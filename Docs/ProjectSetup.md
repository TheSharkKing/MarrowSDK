Watch the step-by-step <b>MarrowSDK [Project Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5jynJcDjvo)</b>, the <b>[Getting Started Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4B0TOG-b94)</b> on YouTube or follow the written guide below.


## Download and Install Unity

- Download [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download). 
- If you already have Unity Hub installed (recommended), you can quickly install Unity version `2021.3.16f` by copying the following unityhub link into a browser: `unityhub://2021.3.16f1`.  The [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) is recommended to help manage different versions of Unity and multiple projects.  Otherwise, [download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) Unity `2021.3.16f` manually from the Unity Archives. 
- When installing Unity `2021.3.16f`, be sure to include the following modules: Under <b>Platforms</b>, select *Android Build Support* and it's sub-items, *Android SDK & NDK Tools* and the *OpenJDK*.  Lower down the list, add *Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)*.

- Once Unity is installed, create a <b>New Project</b>.  If you have other Unity Editor versions, be sure to select `2021.3.16f` from the list at the top of the window.

## Add the SLZ Scoped Registry
